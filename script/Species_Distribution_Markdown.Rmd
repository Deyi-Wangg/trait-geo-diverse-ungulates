Introduction 
=============================
The following script describes the steps that need to be taken to construct a species distribution model based on MaxEnt.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
