fried1953 [14]: The concept of class and class structure is not new to China. Long before the Chinese Communists appeared with their particularly class oriented messages, Chinese social theorists had understood that Chinese society is not structurally homogeneous. The classic Chinese class analysis deals with four major groups in the population; from top to bottom, the scholars, the farmers, the artisans and the merchants. There are also many special statuses, most of them regarded as declassés from the point of view of the scholars; these have included soldiers, actors, and yamen runners among others. This classical concept is neither naive nor inapplicable, yet it is certainly inadequate for the analysis of contemporary Chinese social structure. Too many crucial statuses are not included and the order of grading is susceptible to deep criticism. The scholars of Ch'u were well aware of this and frequently complained to me about the reversal of social positions under the impact of new political and economic forces and the effect of long time inflation. The anthropologist, Fei Hsiao-tung, made first-hand studies of class in several Chinese communities. Fei considers the peasantry and the gentry to be the two major classes in Chinese society. Admittedly, such a scheme is even more simplified than the classical four-class theory. A major gain, however, is the clarification of one of the central facts and processes of Chinese society, the relationships between the landlord-officialdom and the peasantry.

fried1953 [15]: Thus, for example, rich artisans, wealthy merchants, and prominent landlords differ greatly in the precise techniques and areas of wealth accumulation, but are very similar in their relationship to the basic productive facilities. Likewise, agricultural laborers and journeymen artisans do quite disparate types of work but are akin in the fact that they earn wages.

Yet, even though the goods were acquired individually, were in theory individual property, and could even be disposed of by will, the shagund were not absolutely his. ... Thus in shagund it seems that the concepts of lineage property and individual property merged. ... A wealthy man (an yz, ""master"") had the respect of his peers, for wealth accumulation was the result not only of one's skill, intelligence and shrewdness, but also of luck - the benevolence of Masters of wilderness domains and their intermediaries. Hence the informal leadership roles in Nivkh society were open to an yz. ... Good fortune, however, was given to an individual; it was not inheritable or transferable. A man's prestige died with him.

Good families were those with fine manners, who produced able hunters and distinguished warriors consistently, whose members were hard workers, and who, in consequence, were rich.

A form of chieftainship does exist, but the prerogatives of this office are few. Such status divisions as castes, social classes, and specialized occupations are quite unknown.
Apart from age and sex, such status differences as do exist depend primarily upon how the duties of everyday life are performed. If a man is a good hunter, his status is apt to be high; if he is a poor provider, it is apt to be low. His status as a hunter, moreover, is enhanced considerably by his being a virile sex partner; having several wives is a mark of distinction. A woman`s status, too, depends not only on her being active in the economic pursuits of the family but on her being a good childbearer as well. A childless woman stands at the bottom of the status hierarchy within the family.
Little status is gained through genealogy. Within the band, those people who are most closely related to the chief probably enjoy the greatest number of privileges, but I was unable to confirm this as an outstanding feature of Siriono society. It is probably true, to be sure, that the brother of a chief enjoys more privileges than a distantly related cousin.

mayburylewis1967 [198]: The chief therefore influences public opinion far more than he issues orders. It is thus particularly important to distinguish between his power and his ability to influence others, which I call prestige. A man cannot aspire to the chieftaincy unless he has prestige and once he has achieved that status he can only function as a chief through the exercise of prestige. (...) Prestige may be acquired in various ways. I have already shown how Apewe selected his kinsmen for positions of leadership at an early age and in effect groomed them for prominence in the community. Men like Waarodí and Sibupá were i-dzu because they were influential members of the dominant faction at Sao Domingos and as such they had prestige and could exercise its concomitant, influence. Yet there is nothing automatic in this process. If a strong chief patronised an i-dzu who showed himself to be a poor athlete or, worse still, hesitant and a weak orator, the man's prestige would be negligible. The chief's patronage and the ascriptive title  of i-dzu who represent a guarantee of prestige only if the client can display the necessary qualities. These qualities are self-assertiveness, oratorical skill, athletic prowess and ceremonial expertise.

The devision of Amhara society into tax-paying peasants ( 'gebar', sing.) and a nonfarming elite ('mekwanint') was crosscut by a distinction between laymen and churchmen. The elite was thus divided into men who held secular, essentially military, titles on the one hand, and high ecclesiastic officials on the other. Correspondingly, the farming population was (and is) divided into lay peasants (usually called 'chewa' in the region I studied) and clergy ('kahinat') who also engage in agriculture. Above both the secular and ecclesiastic branches of the elite, at the apex of the stratification system, was the Emperor, the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the King of the Kings of Ethiopia. (...)
Though there were great differences in power, honor, and wealth between the peasantry and the elite, the cultural distance between them was not so great an in most other agrarian civilizations.

hoben1970 [191, 192]: The Amhara frequently speak of the nobility ('mekwannint'), the clergy (' Kahanant'), and the farming population ('gebaroch') as basic and complementary social categories. (...) These differences had to do with the relatively low degree of differentiation in life-style-i.e., forms of social organization ideas and ideals- between the Amhara ""peasantry"" and the overarching military and ecclestiacical elites. The Amhara farmer and his lord did not consider themselves to be of different breed or blood. Often they claimed descent from a common ancestor and acknowledged bilaterally traced ties of kinship.

At the top were the great landowners who maintained political and military control; below them were the clergy, the small landowners, and the tenant farmers.

The separation of urban and rural Egyptian society has resulted in differences in the social stratification of the two groups. ... Egyptian society, whether urban or rural, has until recently emphasized land ownership as the primary source of social status. It was this rather than any principle of inherited class status which constituted the basic criterion for the order of the rungs of the social ladder. Egyptian society has not been characterized by any system of fixed classes or by an aristocracy on the amount of land it inherited or acquired; the ability to accumulate more land was enhanced by favors granted in court and by appointments received in the government. By the same token, a family could lose status directly by loss of its lands - or by falling afoul of the government authorities, which usually resulted in loss of lands. Status could be acquired in other ways - by promotion in the government, by advancement in the professions or in the army, or by advantageous marriage - but rise in the status had to be confirmed through the subsequent conversion of wealth to landholdings.
harris1957 [285]: Social differentiation is much less pronounced in the villages than in the city. Leaving aside the largest landowners, who are usually absentees, there are not very wide social gaps between resident peasant landowners, tenant farmers,and hired laborers. Differences in status are especially lessened by the fact that the most important extended kin groups may include both poor and wealthy members.

In Sakaltutan people occupying similar positions on the prestige scale do not associate more with each other than with people below or above them, nor do they develop common interests or common customs to set them apart. Thus it is incorrect to speak of classes or strata. In Elbasi one or two of the village leaders did tend to set themselves apart from and above the rest of the village and adopt elements of urban middle-class culture which their neighbours totally lacked. But this development had not gone far enough to justify speaking of a separate social class or stratum.
stirling1965 [139]: No one son would inherit both the wealth and the unique position in the network of contacts and patronage that gave his father power. Of course, the sons of an eminent and wealthy father would start with advantages, ... A priori then, the possibility of employing labour and even retainers, if it introduced a greater social distance between the top of village society and the bottom, did not prevent a high rate of social mobility between households and lineages. In spite of complications and occasional conspicuous exceptions, the main features of the model seem to hold. As long as land was a free good, a man with a minimum of capital with which to start cultivating, good health and many sons could establish a high ranking position in the village society, but without giving any one son more than a slight lead over his neighbours in the new race for wealth and power.
stirling1965 [146]: In general then, over much of Anatolia, the village social system worked against the maintenance of wealth in any one household or line of households through more than one generation. Broad was the way and easy the path to mediocrity or poverty, through the division of the land, illness, premature deaths, the birth of too many daughters, the barrenness of wives or the death of oxen. But straight as it was, the gate to prosperity was open, through the sucessful rearing of many sons to provide economic resources and fighting men for the expansion of household power and wealth.

It is they also who, by reminding others of these obligations, are in the best position to accumulate wealth.

It must be emphasized that it is not primarily an alignment on the basis of wealth. As the outcome of these ritual divisions, three social classes are distinguished: firstly chiefly families (paito ariki), and secondly commoner families (paito fakaarofa); these latter are divided again into those which have a ritual elder as their head (paito pure) and those whose headmen have no ritual privileges of any note.

firth1936 [359]: The class distinction between houses in Tikopia is not made on the basis of wealth, but at the same time the distribution of wealth has a bearing on it. The Tikopia, like other more civilized communities, have a great respect for the possessor of material goods, and are apt to accord him privileges normally above those of his formal station. A poor man is described as ""a bat""; like that animal he is devoid of possessions and must live upon the bounty of others. He has no stores of his own upon which to rely.

But this does not mean that there was actually just one lineage or whatever was the fundamental unit.

The chief's wife and children were also called by the chielfly title, ti'ya, but while a brother was called tiya, his children were not unless he succeeded to the position.
J.A. stressed the chief's wealth, but could not specify exact methods of acquiring it. She implied that the chief made a slight profit on all money exchanges which he handled. Moreover, any traveler coming with something to sell first went to the chief's house, as any visitor would, where the chief had the first opportunity to buy and, as a result, could resell at a higher price. J.A. said, ""Anyone down here who saved money could get to be tiya,"" but one had to dream [of Eagle], and ""anyone who helped poor people was called tiya."" But such a man was not confused with the chief of a chiefly lineage, and he could not acquire an Eagle lineage totem by this means. His prestige was due to his success, and his influence lay in his personality.
gayton1930 [372]: The social organization of the Yokuts and Western Mono tribes was exceedingly simple. There was a complete absence of anything like a class or caste system.

The ""classes"" within the Indian society are extremely fluid and mobile, lack formal internal organization, and fluctuate in time with the fortunes of families and individuals.

baxterandbutt1953 [51]: The sharp distinction in status between Avungara and commoners dominates Zande life, but there is an additional distinction, which is also important, between the Ambomu conquerors, who accompanied the Avungara, and the conquered peoples known generally as auro or strangers. This is not a formalized distinction, like that which elevates the Avungara.

B 33: The Fur have had to resort to the Arabic language for words to express the distinction between rich ... and poor ... Property consists of houses, domestic articles, rolls of cloth, cattle, crops, the yield of saltpans, weapons and copies of the Koran. To own ten cattle is to be a wealthy commoner but the scale for chiefs is much higher; twenty goats or sheep, two or three horses, four donkeys and forty rolls of cloth are possessions out of the ordinary. Rights of property are vested in the individual owner and a wife receives her portion of the bridewealth for disposal if she chooses ... Land is vested in the fief and village and its revenues in the old days were at the disposal of the sultan. [data gathered in 1936, pinpoint: 1880]

B 10: Such was the Fur social structure. Its two characteristics are the territorial basis of social rank and the strong hereditary principle; the former is evident from the description of the personages who make up the social scene and the fact that even holy men were awarded their revenue-producing estates and the latter is patent from a study of the families of the chiefs, subchiefs and village sheikhs of today, who practically all have their origin in the ruling houses and respected clans of the distant past. But as in all states and empires, it is the common man whose daily labours support the aristocracy, whether of office or birth, and it is with the daily life and customs of the ordinary man that this note is primarily concerned.

The old residents of the village have informal inherited right of use of certain fields. These are not inalienable. (...)
Not infrequently, the more well-to-do tenant farmer will in fact do no farming himself, but will hire labor in his fields for a share of the crop, or other payments.
barth1953 [23]: The laborer himself has no capital to invest in equipment. The tenant farmer pays the laborer the customary share for doing the threshing, ...
barth1953 [23-24]: Conceivably, the laborer might save or borrow enough money to procure a thresher, and then be in a position to take on more work and thus increase his income. What the laborer with access to such capital in fact does, however, is to become a tenant farmer by obtaining the minimal equipment necessary for farming. He then rises one notch in the class hierarchy, and employs laborers in the peak season of the harvest!
A class distinction is thus constantly reinforced within each village by these dispositions of capital and labor, dividing it into the distinct groups of tenant farmers and laborers - sapani (harvestmen) in Kurdish terms.
barth1953 [24]: This two-class distinction is sufficient as far as the tenant village is concerned. The landowner and his family, occupying a third class position, are usually residents of a nearby larger town.

Zamindars differ in their social status in accordance with the size of their landholdings.

eglar1960 [44]: Exclusive ownership of land has given the zamindars, as a group, a position superior to that of the kammis, and land is the form of property for which the kammis have had the greatest longing.
Among the zamindars themselves, size of landholding is the basis on which social prestige is measured. A zamindar with large landholdings has more power, prestige, and influence, because he has more tenants and kammis who are attached to the land, work for him, and depend on him, than has a zamindar who has little land and, consequently, fewer tenants, or one who tills his own land. Having more land, a zamindar has more income, entertains more people, can make more connections, can extend his influence further into official circles, and therefore can help more people and command more repect; in this way he increasingly acquires power, influence, and prestige.

eglar1960 [45]: Since to a zamindar land is the source of his power, he wants to keep it in his line.

They reveal minor divergences in dialect and ceremonial, but they chiefly differ in the fact that the Tarthar division owns all the higher sacred herds and dairies while the Teivali division alone furnishes the sacred dairymen who tend them. The Tarthar division, which is much larger, considers itself superior. Each moiety is subdivided into a number of exogamous clans, which are territorial rather than totemic in nature. The Tarthar division contains twelve clans; the Teivali, six.

rivers1906 [680]: The most obvious features which mark off the two divisions from one another occur in connexion with the dairy organisation. The most important dairy institutions of the Todas belong to the Tartharol, but their dairymen are Teivaliol. (...) The highest dairy office, that of 'palol'[the dairyman of a 'ti',the most sacred dairy institution of the Todas], can only held by a Teivali man, while the lower offices of 'kaltmokh'[the attendant on a 'palol'] and 'wursol'[the dairyman of a Tarthar dairy] must be held by them or by one of the Melgars clan of the Tartharol.

rivers1906 [680,681]: Although the Teivaliol hold the highest dairy offices, and while holding them have a very high degree of sanctity, it is quite clear that, apart from holding these offices, they have no sanctity whatever. (...) Further, the fact that the Teivaliol hold these sacred offices does not lead to any respect being shown by Tarharol towards Teivaliol; there is not the slightest trace of the belief that their right to exert the highest priestly functions gives the Teivaliol any superiority, nor, it seemed clear to me, did the right inspire the Teivaliol themselves with any feelings of superiority. Indeed, it was distinctly the other way . The Tartharol always boasted that they were the superior people and that the Teivaliol were there servants, and the Teivaliol always seemed to me to acquiesce, though unwillingly, in this opinion.

High-ranking kin groups were ordinarily wealthy, but the distinction between mere wealth and wealth plus social position was never overlooked.

Palauans do not and evidently did not conceive of broad segments of society which might be termed classes. Stratification was pertinent to specific village kin group structures which in turn fitted into a pan-Palau structure of villages in which there was also stratification based on relative ranks.
Relative wealth, numerical size, and traditional prestige were attributes relied upon in the determination of kin group rank. Within rather narrow limits upward mobility was possible. A senior-ranking sib was supposed to be the wealthiest sib in the village. This was not always true in fact and the alterations in village hierarchies from time to time reflect the fact that some sibs declined in wealth, prestige, and power while others advanced. Possession of wealth was one means which enalbled a sib to maintain its social prestige.

The position was nominally an elected one but tended to be hereditary in practice, (...)
hassig1988 [29f]: Below the nobility were the commoners, the 'macehualtin' (sing. 'macehualli'), who formed the bulk of Aztec society. They were organized by calpolli, worked with their hands, and paid tribute in goods and labor until the age of fifty-two. However, some particularly important commoner groups, such as the merchants and artisans, were exempt from some types of labor obligations and paid tribute in their wares.
Another group of commoners, the mayehqueh or 'tlalmaitin' (sing. 'tlalmaitl'), were permanent laborers on the patrimonial lands of the nobility. This was a hereditary position, and except for war service the mayehqueh were exempt from tribute obligations.
Below both the macehualtin and the mayehqueh were the slaves ('tlatlacohtin; sing. 'tlacohtli'). These slaves had usually sold themselves into service, although some had been enslaved as punishment for criminal acts. The rights of their owners were limited, and except for labor, slaves were free, could marry, and could own property, including other slaves.

One finds but few of these except in the larger centers; in Mirebalais they number not more than five or six. (...) In another category are those known as malheureux - folk who are usually, though not always, incompetent, but who are generally regarded as unlucky. They may work hard on their land, but their crops fail or yield meagerly; they may obtain a job, but something goes wrong with it - the work is temporary, or they cannot collect the wages due them, or illness follows every period of employment. The second group comprises the middle class. This class contains such an overwhelming proportion of the population that no special term is applied to its members. They are comfortably situated, according to Haitian standards, living frugally on their habitations with their families where their lives follow an equitable course, and through them the body of Haitian culture flows, for they are its principal carriers. In the third class is included the gros nègre and the grand nègre. The first is a man of wealth and position, the owner of a large plantation, and frequently also a former high officer in the Haitian army or in the old Caco brigades, or a man who may have successfully stood for local or national offices. The grand nègre is conceived in Mirebalais to be a man of spiritual power, as represented in the more active and renowned priests of the vodun cult and the successful practitioners of magic. Together, the two categories may be thought of as constituting the outstandingly successful members of the community, in contrast to the first class, which includes its outstanding failures.

The first, the lowest both economically and socially, was that of the slaves.

B 101: An intermediary group between the slaves and the free Dahomeans consisted of those born in Dahomey of slave parentage, or of slave and free Dahomean parents. (...) The third economic class of Dahomey included the free farmers and artisans who were the backbone of the Dahomean state. From this class the soldiers were drawn, it was this class which furnished the iron-workers, the weavers, the jewelers, the potters, and all of those who gave to Dahomey its variety of artists and craftsmen. It was from this class, also, that political as well as economic strength was recruited, for royalty, no less than the slaves, constituted a class apart, and it was only from the middle-class group that the King could draw the chiefs and administrators essential to the governing of the kingdom.

C 102: Atop the pyramided structure of Dahomean society was the leisure class, composed principally of the rulers - the men on whose shoulders lay the reponsibility for the successful governing of the kingdom - and the ranking members of the priestly hierarchy. It numbered both men and women - men whose word was heard in council and who issued orders, women who were never heard publicly, but whose advice constantly guided the voices of those who rendered decisions.

But, since the arziki concept is, as we have implied, a highly complex one, involving such elements as birth, prestige, political protection, large family, good farming, money, and wealth or greater than average consumption, among others, the relations of occupations one to another in terms of arziki cannot be simple. Koranic scholars and teachers (mallamai, sing. mallam) who undertake to live largely by charity, and sometimes do so, are for reasons of religious prestige as an occupational class socially superior to butchers, though in features other than birth, prestige and learning, the arziki of butchers generally exceeds that of the mallamai. Similarly, however wealthy he mith be, a slave was rated lower than a free man. A man might have great arziki for a slave, but arziki for a free man differed considerably. That is to say, to each social status, each occupational class, there is an appropriate type and degree of arziki. For the mallamai high levels of alms (sodaka), knowledge (ilmi), and so forth; for those eligible by birth for independent political office, the sarakuna (sing. sarki), arziki is enjoyment of suitable office, promotion and so forth; for attajirai (rich merchants) arziki involves commercial success but also includes a large family, many dependants, good political relationships and generosity. The axiom could be stated, then, that to each occupation there is a different arziki, and the converse is equally true, since, to proceed to the absurd, attajirai who lived on charity would not be congratulated on their arziki as attajirai; nor is the man who abandons the life of learning for successful trade any longer occupied as a mallam.

smith1955b [14]: Community stratification by class and wealth requires fuller discussion. Briefly, among the Hausa the wealthy man (mai-arziki) is either a successful trader or a successful office holder. True wealth, the thing that all Hausa admire and strive for, but fewattain, can, under present conditions, come to a man in no other way. Before the British occupation there was a third source of wealth based on slave-owning, and the master of many slaves, as we shall see, was also the enjoyer of fortune (arziki). But this source is no longer open.

pumphrey1941 [12]: The other reason for the inordinate growth of the Kwar Reth is their great wealth. Unit the Turkish Government began its not very successful attempts at governing the Shilluk with the assistance of their Reths the latter were extremely rich in cattle.

pumphrey1941 [10]: The four elements existing to-day in the tribe are Kwar Reth, Ororo, Collo and Bang Reth. The first two together comprise all the patrilineal descendants of Nyikang, the last two the subject body of the tribe. There is no outward difference between the members of these for strata of society either in physique or apparel, and although the Kwar Reth, and less so the Ororo, are usually treated with a certain outward defence by the Collo, little of the original practical difference between conquerors and conquered now survives. Numerically the Collo vastly predominate. The Kwar Reth are simply an enlarged clan and account for perhaps a fifteenth of the tribe. The Bang Reth are perhaps little more numerous than the Kwar Reth, and the Ororo, who are as will later be seen a mere segment of the Kwar Reth, are numerically negligible.

pumphrey1941 [11]: The Kwar Reth is vastly bigger than any other clan. The reasons for its abnormal growth are two, namely their comparatively great wealth with the consequent tendency to marry more wives, and the cunning process of dissemination whereby the Kwar Reth have been gradually planted out and have taken root in every part of the Shilluk kingdom.

mainga1973 [40]: In the same way the bureaucracy might develop vested interests of its own; the Indunas might become less dependent on the king for appointment for promotion and more dependent on hereditary rights, especially since land rights went with office.
mainga1973 [52]: In this way, the status of the newly created bureaucratic aristocracy was raised above that of the ordinary people.

SCCS41,Tuareg Ahaggar,xd506,hogg1238,Hoggar,Afro-Asiatic,SCCS1751,4,complex stratification into more than two classes,1898,Ahaggaren tribe,"nicolaisen1963 [10-12]: The true Tuareg in most groups fall into several classes as follows:- Ihaggaren (sing. Ahaggar), or Imajeren (sing. Amajer). These two words designate the supreme Tuareg class which is generally referred to in literature as ""nobility"". ...
Ineslemen (sing. Aneslem). This class is that of Mrabetin or marabuts, the religious class established after the introduction of Islam. In most Tuareg groups there are whole tribes of Ineslemen under the leadership of their own chiefs, but in Ahaggar there are only a few scattered families. The political position of the Ineslemen varies greatly from one group to another. Certain tribes in Ayr which are Ineslemen by origin have the same status as the true vassals to be mentioned below, while other Ineslemen tribes like the Iforas of the Kel Ajjer have much the same status as noble Tuareg with the exception that they have no vassals. ...
Echchikhen (sing. Echchikh). This word also refers to people of religious status, and is used almost synonymously with Ineslemen. ...
Isekkemaren (sing. Asekkemar). A class which is found only in the two northern groups - particularly among the Kel Ahaggar. The Isekkemaren Tuareg descend from Arabs, or from unions between Arab men and Tuareg women. They are vassals who have a somewhat different status from that of true vassals, who are mentioned below.
Iregenaten (sing. Aregenat). This is not always applied to people of a particular class. It is used as a proper name for one Arab tribe which has its origin from mixed marriages between (noble) Tuareg women and Arabs. In most groups the term Iregenaten  ... is applied to Tuareg descending from unions between noble Tuareg men and vassal women. ...
Imrad (sing. Amerid). People of this class are sometimes called ""serfs"" in literature, but the word ""vassals"" is also used.

C 132: For example, a man can sometimes improve his social position, or at least that of his children, by marrying above himself, whereas a woman cannot; for, as I have explained above, Tuareg children inherit the hereditary rank of their mother, no matter whom she marries.

Tout à fait en haut nous trouvons le prêtre de la paroisse, et les religieux qui dépendent de lui. Un peu à part, et dans la région de Kinvarra de facon éphémère, il y a la classe des gens qui sont appelés ""country"" en Angleterre, qui correspondent ici à d'anciennes familles ou à des nobles. Les country people peuvent prendre une certaine importance dans les Midlands. Après viennent les membres d'anciennes familles du bourg, tous ceux qui sont dans l'enseignement, et ceux des professions libérales. Puis les riches fermiers, suivis par les quatre strates des notables du bourg, les artisans et les moyens fermiers, les petits fermiers, et les manoeuvres qui n'ont pas de terres. En bas, et à part, les nomades, tels les tinkers.

cresswell1969 [497]: La première grande division qui s'opère la population de la paroisse est celle qui met les exploitants agricoles d'un côté et les non-exploitants de l'autre. Ceux-ci se subdivisent en groupes professionnels: religieux, médecins, commercants, enseignants, artisans, manoeuvres, etc. Les exploitants se subdivisent selon la grandeur et la richesse de leur fermes, comme nous l'avons déjà vu.

cresswell1969 [498]: La hiérarchie des classes sociales est le résultat des différents degrés de prestige qui s'attachent aux groupes. ... Le premier et le plus important facteur de prestige découle de la religion. Avoir des soeurs ou des prêtres dans la famille confère un prestige important, et rehausse le statut social de tous les membres de la famille. ... La richesse est aussi un facteur de prestige, à la condition de ne pas être ostentatoire.

SCCS71,Burmese,xd709,nucl1310,Burmese,Sino-Tibetan,SCCS1751,4,complex stratification into more than two classes,1948,Nondwin village,"spiro1977 [35]: Land, as we have already seen, is the most important form of wealth in the village, not only as an economic asset, but as a source of prestige-based village stratification system.
Roughly, villagers distinguish three social classes. The lower class (au`tansa) consists of landless loggers and basketmakers, almost all of whom are relatively recent immigrants. The middle class (ale-tansa) consists of two typs of small landholders. One type consists of descendants of small landowning families, the other of those who acquired their holdings as a result of nationalization [consider, that according to Nash (A 15) the land reform program had not been carried out in Nondwin]. A similar distinction is found in the upper class (ahte`tansa) which, again, is based on land. One type is exemplified by those villagers who, although they do not own much land today, are descended from traditional upper class families - that is, families that have once been large landowners, or whom the traditionally prestigeful offices of headman and elder had been hereditary. The other type is representd by relatively recent large landowners who have no connection with the traditional upper class.

The position was unofficial and the natives seem to have had no generic term for such leaders. They are now referred to by the French word 'Notables'. The Notables were heads of lineages or large families, rich men, famous warriors, etc.

linton1939b [255]: Apart from objects for wear or use, there were two types of property, the chief use of which was toward prestige goal. These were money and cattle.

linton1939b [256]: We see then, that the prestige value of property was of tremendous importance in the native mind. It was intimately bound up with the whole pattern of family and lineage control. The main incentive for its accumulation was the desire for power and control over collaterals and descending generations.

linton1939b [257]: In the absence of trading and banking, the accretion of wealth to the gens was consequently very slow. Cattle raiding was practically the only sure method. The main wealth of the individual was that which he acquired by inheritance from the older generation, or by gifts.
