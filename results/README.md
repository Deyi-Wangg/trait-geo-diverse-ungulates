Environmental niche modelling results
===========

The results are divided into three sections: (i) the results per species, (ii) outlying mean index, (iii) the combinations of results. The results per species folder contain the maxent results, a map with raw occurence data, variable importance, response curve and predicted niche maps. The outlying mean index folder contains, a table with normalized site traits per species and a table with the raw site traits per species. The maxent folder contain the combined results of results per species and outlying mean index folder. It contains dataframes with clusters of alike species, dendrograms of these clusters and the phylogenetic trees based on the three methods used (1. niche trait space overlap derived from maxent projections. 2. niche trait space overlap derived from raw occurrence points. 3. niche space overlap derived from maxent projections) .
