# trait-geo-diverse-ungulates

Project repository for the analysis of abiotic niches of Ungulates. Contains
source code (R) and data files. The overall layout is as follows:

- `script` - source code
- `data` - CSV files with species occurrences
- `results` - output from niche modelling (e.g. maxent output)
- `doc` - documentation files

The source code that is being developed is intended to be portable such that
analysis workflows can be prototyped on laptops, while longer running analyses
can be executed in a cloud environment.
